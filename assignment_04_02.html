    <h1>CSIS 430 OS Assignment 4</h1>
    <h2>Team 2</h2>
    <h3>Johnathan Lee<br>Thierry Oke<br>Nirisha Shrestha<br>Santosh Kandel</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Roles</h4>
    <p>Each group member completed their own version of this assignment</p>
    <h4>Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
    To allow for priority scheduling, a <code>uint priority</code> field was added to the struct <code>proc</code>. This field is assumed to be (and is later checked as being) from 0...20, inclusive, 
    where 0 is the lowest priority and 20 the highest.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scheduling was implemented with a dead-simple "pick greatest" algorithm. Every time control is returned to the scheduler, it goes through the entire list of processes (all NPROC of them),
    and finds the one with the highest priority. If there are multiple elements with the same (highest) priority, it will simply take the first in the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    In more algorithmic form:
    <pre><code>
let highest be the first process in the list
for each process in the list:
  if highest isn't runnable or highest's priority is less than the process's:
    set highest to process

if highest is runnable:
  switch to highest
    </code></pre>
    Note that we explicitly check if highest is runnable. This is because xv6 apparently starts the scheduler before the init process is spawned. 
    This means there isn't any runnable process (or indeed any process) in the ptable for several iterations.
    </p>

    <h4>Modifications Made</h4>
    <p>
    The following files were modified/created to complete this assignment.<br>
    Note that <i>all</i> .c/.h files were formatted using clang-format in order to keep everything consistent, so all files are technically different. <br>
    Also note that .h files have had <code>#pragma once</code> added to them, and some (like user.h) have had include statements for types.h added, as they depend on the types within.

    <h4>Description of Modifications</h4>
    <h5>Processes and Scheduling</h5>
    <p>
      See the algorithm section.
    </p>
    <h5>chpr systemcall</h5>
    <p>
      <code>chpr</code> takes two arguments: The PID of the process to modify, and the new priority of that process.<br>
      The priority is checked as being from 0...20, inclusive, and the function will refuse to set the priority if it is not in these bounds.<br>
      The process is also checked to make sure it's actually in the ptable. If it's not, it refuses to do anything.
    </p>
    <h5>cps syscall</h5>
    <p>
      <code>cps</code> takes no arguments, and simply calls a modified version of the procdump function.
    </p>
    <h5>procdump</h5>
    <p>
      The <code>procdump</code> function has been modified to both give a more visually pleasing output and display the priority of each process.
    </p>
    <h5>cpr command</h5>
    <p>
      The cpr command takes two integer arguments: the PID of the process to modify (obtained through <code>ps</code> or similar), and the new priority of that process.<br>
      After calling cpr, that process's priority is set to the input priority.
    </p>
    <h5>ps command</h5>
    <p>
      The ps command takes no arguments, and simply prints a nice list of all processes currently running on the system, their PIDs, priorities, and states.
    </p>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>
      This new scheduling algorithm will indeed always pick the highest priority proc to run. This actually becomes a problem if too
      many myforks are spawned and given priority over other processes, as the algorithm is naive enough that it will just keep picking them over and over again,
      locking the system until they either exit or are killed.<br>
